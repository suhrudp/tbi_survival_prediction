# tbi_survival_prediction
A simple streamlit application to get survival predictions for patients with TBI.

To use it, download the files to the same folder, start your terminal, activate your Python environment (dependencies need to be installed in the environment: streamlit, numpy, pickle, shap, and matplotlib), change directory to the directory where your files are stored, and run the following line: 

\>>>> streamlit run app.py 

You can then input the required variables to get a prediction.
